The code contained in this respository aims to perform some essential tasks to palaeo data. These are often required when working with palaeoecological time series eg., subsetting depths to an age model, combining several proxies from different depths and plotting proxies stratigraphically or doing multivariate numerical analyses to reduce the number of environmental variables.
This is far from a perfect code but that's why we are here, to make it better. Please tell me if you find typos or have better ideas to make the very same task.
